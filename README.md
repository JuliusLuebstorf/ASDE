# ASDE

## What to do to start the project:
To make the project run, it is important to start the file /proj4/src/main/java/asde/proj4/Proj4Application.java in Eclipse first. Then, the react part can be started in the folder p4react. You will have to register for the application as soon as it starts. In the dashboard, you can select games and see a leaderboard for the online game.
